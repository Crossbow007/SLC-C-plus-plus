/**********************************************************
Lab Exercise #4:  Correct the syntax and run time errors
This program calculates and prints an employee's pay
Help:  First, before trying to run the program, try to find
and correct as many errors as you can.

Hint: This program appears all green. Which means it is a comment.
Youâ€™ll need to end the comment. C++ is case sensitive.
Donâ€™t forget the header files! Next, try running the program.
Click on View>Error List and work  through each error from the first one down.
After you have corrected the errors, run it again.
Compare the answer calculated by the computer with a calculator.

Hint: all programs follow input-process-output order.
If you still canâ€™t find all of the errors, compare the code
to a program that works. Often itâ€™s the smallest errors that are missed.
