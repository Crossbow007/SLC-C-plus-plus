/* Name: Kevin Gao       Lab Exercise #3: input/output

If you like, you can complete this exercise on your own.
I will walk through the changes during the lab. You can check to see if youâ€™re doing it right.
The following program asks a user for his/her name and the number of text messages sent.

It then computes the cost for the text messages and prints the following:
<-------20-----><----10---><-----10-----><-----10----->
Name             # of texts     Cost/text    Total Cost

J. Doe         40          .10          4.00
*/

int main()
{
	//housekeeping: declare variables, a constant for cost per text and set output rules        
	string name;
	int noTexts;
	double totalCost;
	const double TEXT_COST=.1;
	cout << fixed<<setprecision(2);
		//input: ask user for name and number of text messages    
	cout << "What is your name? ";
	getline(cin, name);
	cout << "Enter number of texts: ";
		cin >> noTexts;
	//processing: compute cost by multiplying number of texts by cost per text 
	totalCost = noTexts * TEXT_COST;
	//output: align data in columns, add a blank line after the title, left justify name    
	cout << setw(20)<<left<<"Name"

	cout << setw(20) << left << name 
		 << setw(10) << right << noTexts
		 << setw(10) << TEXT_COST
		 << setw(10) << totalCost << endl;
		cout << endl << "Program ended successfully" << endl;
